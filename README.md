Treccani - Ãˆ saggio
=================================================

Preamble
====
Friday morning. Everything is /effort, so I made RESTful APIs for Treccani, the most important Italian encyclopedia.
I don't know how many idiots worked on this website, but the source it's an ugliness that you don't see everyday.
[Descartes](https://github.com/RoxasShadow/Descartes) should be happier now.

Install
====
`gem install treccani`
